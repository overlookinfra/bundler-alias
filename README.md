# Bundler Alias

This [bundler plugin](https://bundler.io/guides/bundler_plugins.html) allows you
to select between multiple more or less equivalent gem implementations without
requiring upstream accommodations. This is useful, for example, when a defunct
project is forked to keep it alive, but the ecosystem hasn't caught up and
updated all the dependencies yet.

## Use Case

This was initially developed to aid in testing Puppet modules after the
[OSS Puppet rug pull](https://overlookinfratech.com/2024/11/08/sequestered-source/).
The testing framework is all Ruby based, so the first step in testing any Puppet
module is, you guessed it, `bundle install`.

Updating your own `Gemfile` is pretty straightforward. And when using ModuleSync
it's not too difficult to [push that change out to all your modules](https://github.com/voxpupuli/modulesync_config/commit/bcae6e8382f121ea4d1146901051cb9cce7f11ae).

But what about when you depend on a gem like `puppet-strings` that has a transitive
dependency on `puppet`? You'll end up with both `openvox` and `puppet` installed.
In this particular case, it's (probably) ok because glob order finds `openvox` first.
But what if you want to test your module against both implementations or you're not
lucky enough a lexicographically ordered name?

That's actually not possible to do in a reasonable manner without this plugin.


## Usage

First install the plugin:

```
$ bundle plugin install "bundler-alias"
```

Then configure your alias(es):

```
$ bundle config set aliases 'puppet:openvox'
```

And then `bundle install` and  run your tests as usual. Any gem that requires `puppet`
will be transparently rewritten to depend on `openvox` instead. Now your tests will
actually test what you expect them to be testing.

### Alias specification

The specification for aliases is a comma separated list of colon separated aliases.
This means `"source:target,source2:target2,source3:target3"` and so on.


### Global installation

If you so choose, you can install and configure the plugin globally so that all
projects will rewrite dependencies transparently. Be forewarned that this will
affect every `bundle install` command you run.

```
$ cd ~ # ensure you're in your home directory
$ bundle plugin install "bundler-alias"
$ bundle config set --global aliases 'puppet:openvox'
```

## Limitations

This alias is not smart. It doesn't know anything about version numbers, or breaking
changes or really anything except the name of gems. This means that when there are
actual major breaking changes, this trivial rewriting of gem names will not be
sufficient and code written for one gem will break on the other. In the case of
*testing* that is acceptable because it means that tests break and surface the
need for code updates. But if you're using this to band-aid over dependencies in
production, be aware that it's a very thin and fragile veneer.
